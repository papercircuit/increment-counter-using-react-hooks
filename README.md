# React Hook Examples

This app is intended to be a simple showcase of React Hooks. Each file in examples/ is a self-contained example of a hook. 

## Running the app

To run the app, simply run `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Adding a new example

To add a new example, simply create a new file in examples/ and add it to the list of examples in App.js. The file should export a function that returns a React component. The component should be a function component that uses a hook. The component should also have a `displayName` property that is the name of the hook.
